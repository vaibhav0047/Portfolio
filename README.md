This is my portfolio. This project utilizes a variety of web development skills and technologies to create a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly website. Here's a brief explanation of the key skills and technologies used:

HTML:

The foundational markup language used to structure the content of the website. Elements like sections, headings, paragraphs, lists, and links are defined here.
CSS:

Selectors and Properties: Basic styling for elements including margins, padding, colors, and text alignment.
Flexbox: Used extensively for layout, allowing for responsive design and alignment of elements in a flexible manner.
Media Queries: Ensure the website is responsive, adapting the layout and styles based on different screen sizes.
Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Enhance interactivity and style elements based on their state or position, such as :hover and ::after.
Animations and Transitions: Add smooth changes to styles, such as hover effects and element transformations.
Responsive Design:

Ensures the website looks and functions well on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones, through the use of flexible layouts and media queries.
Google Fonts:

External fonts ("Poppins" and "Ubuntu") are imported and applied to different sections of the website, enhancing typography and overall aesthetic.
JavaScript (Menu Button):

Interactivity: JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens, making the site more interactive and user-friendly.
CSS Grid and Flexbox:

Utilized for advanced layout designs, allowing for the creation of complex and responsive grid structures and flexible box layouts.
CSS Transitions and Transforms:

Applied to create smooth visual effects for hover states and other interactive elements, enhancing user experience.
Background Images and Gradients:

Custom background images and gradients are used to provide a visually appealing design.
Icon Fonts (e.g., Font Awesome):

Icon fonts are used for scalable and customizable icons throughout the website.
Shadow and Hover Effects:

Box shadows and hover effects are used to create a sense of depth and interactivity, making the design more dynamic and engaging.
These skills combined create a polished, professional-looking website that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, providing a good user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
